Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.<br>
<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
 of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

<a href = "https://www.naver.com" target="_blank" title="yahoo!"> this is good </a>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive 
forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. <br>
